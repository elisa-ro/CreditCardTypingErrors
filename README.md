# CreditCardTypingErrors
Checking for any typing errors in credit cards. 

This is inspired by a LinkedIn post I came across:

## Time and Space Complexity
Time complexity is linear and space complexity is constant. This is an improvement of the O(n) space complexity using data structures that I initially had.

## Testing
Tested using the LinkedIn post example and personal credit cards.
